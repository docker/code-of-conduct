# Docker Code of Conductv2

**We expect all participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
related social events.**

Exhibitors, speakers, sponsors, staff and all other attendees at events
organized by Docker, Inc (DockerCon, meetups, user groups) or held at Docker,
Inc facilities are subject to these Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment­-free experience for everyone, and we
do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We ask you to be
considerate of others and behave professionally and respectfully towards all
other participants. Offensive language and imagery, sexual or otherwise, is not
appropriate for any event venue, including talks.

Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event
without a refund at the discretion of the organizers or Docker, Inc staff
members.

Harassment includes (but is not limited to):
- offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or age
- sexual images in public spaces
- deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording
- sustained disruption of talks or other events
- inappropriate or unwanted physical contact
- unwelcome sexual attention

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, contact a member of the event staff immediately. Our event
staff will be happy to help participants address concerns. If you cannot find a
member of the event staff or are not comfortable contacting one of the staff,
you can alternatively contact Ashlynn Polini (ashlynn@docker.com).

All reports will be treated as confidential. We strongly encourage you to
address your issues privately with any of our staff members who are organizing
the event. We encourage you to avoid disclosing information about the incident
until the staff has had sufficient time in which to address the situation.

Please also keep in mind that public shaming can be counter­productive to
building a strong community. We do not condone nor do we participate in such
actions.

We value your attendance!
